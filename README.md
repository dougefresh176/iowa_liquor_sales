Analyses and visualizations of liquor sales in the state of Iowa. I probably got this data set from Jeremy Singer-Vine's "Data is Plural" blog. (https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural). This data is available because Iowa is one of few states that directly runs all liquor stores. Thus, they are able to publish data on them.

If you scroll down the notebook, you'll see a viz of the state of Iowa with sales of liquour by $ plotted. The size of the dots plotted are proportionate to the number of $ sold in that spot.
